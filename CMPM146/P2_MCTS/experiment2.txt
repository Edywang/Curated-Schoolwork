In experiment 2, we tested mcts_vanilla against mcts_modified at 3 different number of nodes: 10, 100, and 1000
We analyzed the win rate of player 2, modified, at each of these nodes and below are our results, as well as plotted in the associated "Experiment 2.png"
The win rates for each of the respective number of nodes is as follows: 75, 63, and 74.
Now this is a very odd result, and we were not sure what to make of it, we expected either a clear decrease or increase in win rate but this is not what we ended up with.
However, it is at least certain that modified performed better than vanilla at all numbers of nodes, it's simply a matter of how much the difference is.
It is possible that because we only played 100 games at each number of nodes, the sample size might just be too small to verify a result but it is odd nonetheless and we weren't sure what to make of it.
