The programs in this folder are from a course named Computer Systems and Assembly Language.
Every folder has a README that contains instructions on running it.
Labs 1 and 2 use MMLogic, Labs 3, 4, and 5, use MARS MIPS Simulator
Below are the learning objectives of each of the labs:

Lab 0 - A personal responsibility agreement

Lab 1 - This lab will introduce you to a schematic entry logic simulation program, Multimedia Logic (MMLogic or MML).
In this lab you will practice creating truth tables and implementing logic based on those truth tables.

Lab 2 - The objective of this lab is to build a sequential logic circuit and introduce data path.

Lab 3 - This lab will introduce you to the MIPS ISA using MARS.
You will create a block diagram and pseudocode to help you design the structure of your program.
Then you will write a program with several nested loops to print a group of ASCII trees to the screen.

Lab 4 - 
1. Take user input from program arguments.
2. Parse a numeric character ASCII string to an integer.
3. Interact with memory.
4. Interact with MIPS Coprocessor 1 to use the floating point registers and instructions.

Lab 5 -
1. Utilize arrays
2. Convert numerical ASCII strings to integers
3. Convert integers to decimal ASCII strings
4. Implement functions
5. Manage data on the stack
6. Use a test file to test functions
7. Use macros to automate programming
