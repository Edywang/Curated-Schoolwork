Please note that although GraphTest.c does include code from the grading scripts of both this program and the previous program,
I have also made some modifications to the grading scripts and testing files that I have incorporated and I'd like to get credit for doing so in order to test
all of the methods, even those that aren't tested directly in the grading script.
